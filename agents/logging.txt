You: hey my name is ruveen
AI: Hi Ruveen! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today?

You: how are you
AI: I'm functioning well, thank you for asking! How are you doing today? Remember though, I'm an AI assistant, so I don't actually experience feelings in the way humans do. But I'm here and ready to help you with whatever you need!
