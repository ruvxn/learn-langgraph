Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'd like to schedule a sprint meeting this Friday from 10 AM to 12 PM at the LateLab to discuss our final development sprint.

Agenda:
10:00 - 10:30 - Review current sprint progress
10:30 - 11:00 - Plan and prioritize tasks for the final development sprint
11:00 - 11:30 - Discuss any blockers or challenges
11:30 - 12:00 - Set key deliverables and timelines

Please come prepared with your updates and any concerns you'd like to address during the meeting.

Could you please confirm your availability for this Friday? Once I hear back from everyone, I'll send a calendar invite for the scheduled time.

Location: LateLab

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
[Your name]
